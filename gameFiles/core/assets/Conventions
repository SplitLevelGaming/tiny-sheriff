Rules for numbering:
-Numbering starts at 1
-Never start a number for an animation sprite at 0. (Such as "walking_left_01" should be "walking_left_1")
-Numbers should always be at the end of a filename

Rules for sprites:
-Must face right
-The fake pixel resolution is 640 width and 360 height. Sprites should be made with these dimensions in mind.
